                        <p>Although I have never been skinny, I had no issues with my weight in high school and
                            college. After I got married and gave birth to my kid (I was 31 back then), things started
                            to change.
                        </p>
                        <p>I thought I would lose weight quickly after pregnancy but instead, I kept gaining weight,
                            till my kid turned 3 years old. For more than 4 years my body was overburdened with fat!<br>

                                cardio every day in the gym. It seemed to me that the more I exercised, the more my body
                                became bigger!</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>I wasn't the only one who found my obstinate, jelly-like belly repulsive.</p>
                        <p>The friends who hadn't seen me in a while
                            remarked with concern how much I had changed… </p>
                        <p> At this stage, I could see no effect from the gym, so I gave it up and began to eat even
                            more to feel better. For two weeks, I ate three times as much food as I usually consume!!!

                        would help. So I went through all the “top” regimes: paleo, keto, Mediterranean, mayo, whole30,
                        etc. I followed celebrities’ advice on how
                        to lose weight fast <b>but NOTHING worked.</b> I still looked like an elephant. I even stopped
                        posting photos of myself on social media being afraid of fat-shamers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Then, I made the decision to spend my money on various expensive fat-burning pills. </p>

                            give me dry and irritated skin, but also headaches and insomnia. Also, I developed
                            gastritis!!!</b>
                    </p>
                    <p> After my failure with the tablets, my real drama started. I fought with my husband every day. In
                        front of the kid. <b> He started calling me hysteric pork and other derogatory names. </b>As
                        expected, the relationship with my husband
                        was getting toxic for both of us. We got divorced. <br> <b> At that time, I was fat, ill and
                            dumped… in total despair.

                    <p><br>Thank God, my depression and obesity didn’t last forever because of a chat with my friend

                        teenager. She surprisingly announced that she

                        <p>It took me a long time to lose weight after giving birth. I didn't feel like getting off the
                            couch, let alone doing anything. Then I tried <a href="#" class="links"><b>Uthin</b> </a>.
                            My husband was confused by all of this;
                            he watched me regain the weight I had before giving birth.

                        <p>I'm sensitive, I have a lot of allergies, but I lost weight without any problems. Oh, and the
                            taste is really nice. With <a href="#" class="links"><b>Uthin</b> </a>, I lost 27 kg! See
                            the difference for yourself:
